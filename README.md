# Stable Diffusion Hackathon
### Developed by Michael Cooley and Ian Penrod (me!)

This was developed via Google Colab, but was uploaded to GitHub at the requested of one of the participant organizers.
The accompanying site was developed and tested locally. To run yourself, make sure you have all of the necessary `import`s downloaded and then `cd` into the directory containing this project and run `streamlit run stable-diffusion-hackathon.py`.
